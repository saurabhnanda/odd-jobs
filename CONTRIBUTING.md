# Contribution Guidelines

I welcome and appreciate contributions.

Broadly speaking, I want to strike a good balance between features, configurability, and ease-of-use - with the last one getting a little more weightage. For example, I don't want `odd-jobs` to devolve into a mess of complicated types and custom monads that, _theoretically_, give a lot of compile-time guarantees, but _practically_ make the library nearly-impossible to use!

1. For small fixes (like obvious typos, obvious ommissions in docs, etc), go ahead and directly open a PR. Please don't worry if the PR is open for a few days - I generally work on things in a batch.
2. For larger features or fixes, it's best to quickly bounce-off the idea on the issue tracker before investing time in writing code. 
  - I already have a broad roadmap in mind for the project (search for [issues tagged with `roadmap`](https://github.com/saurabhnanda/odd-jobs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap)). See if the feature/fix you have in mind is already on the roadmap. Participate in the relevant discussion (on the issue tracker) and let your intent to work on that issue be known.
  - If you want to work on something that is not on the roadmap, raise an issue and start a discussion. Try sharing the real-life use-case for the feature.s

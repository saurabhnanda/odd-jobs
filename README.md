# odd-jobs in production?

If you are already using, or considering using, `odd-jobs` in production, please read [production usage-reports](https://github.com/saurabhnanda/odd-jobs/issues/44). It would be great if you could add your own usage-report to that discussion thread as well. **We need more success stories of Haskell in production!**

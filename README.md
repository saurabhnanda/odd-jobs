# `OddJobs` in production?

If you are already using, or considering using, `odd-jobs` in production, please read [production usage reports](https://github.com/saurabhnanda/odd-jobs/issues/44). It would be really great if you can add your own usage-report to that discussion thread as well. **We need more success stories of Haskell in production!**

Great! We need more
